						I should have listened to her
						<br>I should have listened to her
						<br>So hard to keep control
						<br>We kept on eating but
						<br>Our bloated belly's still not full
						<br>She gave us all she had but
						<br>We went and took some more
						<br>Can't seem to shut her legs
						<br>Our mother nature is a whore
						<br>I got my propaganda
						<br>I got revisionism
						<br>I got my violence
						<br>In hi-def ultra-realism
						<br>All a part of this great nation
						<br>I got my fist
						<br>I got my plan
						<br>I got survivalism
